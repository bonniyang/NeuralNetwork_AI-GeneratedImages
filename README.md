Our primary objective is to determine the origin of the images we encounter, discerning whether they have been generated by artificial intelligence or not. 

We used a self-trained CNN model and experimented with different batch sizes and learning rates. Additionally, we used a pre-trained ViT model from Hugging Face and tuned the learning rate. Both models demonstrated excellent performance, achieving over 95% accuracy.

Data Sources:

The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, comprising approximately 120,000 facial images. Of these, around 70,000 are authentic images captured through conventional photography, while the remaining 51,000 images are AI-generated. The dataset showcases a wide range of facial images, representing various demographics, including different ages, ethnic backgrounds, and genders.
